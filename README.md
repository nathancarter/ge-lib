# Group Explorer Module

## Purpose

This project exposes most of the core functionality of
[Group Explorer 3](https://github.com/nathancarter/group-explorer)
as a node.js module.

## Status

This is in very early stages of development, and you shouldn't
expect anything very useful yet.

Eventually, it should be possible to use these tools to
programmatically load groups and create visualizations into
formats like SVG, PNG, PDF, Asymptote, TikZ, etc.

For now, we're just getting started.  Check back later!

## Documentation

So far we have very little.  We will accumulate it here.
 * [Basic API for this module](docs/basic-api.md)
 * [Drawing cycle graphs](docs/drawing-cycle-graphs.md)
