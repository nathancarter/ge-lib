# Group Explorer Module

## Purpose

This project exposes most of the core functionality of [Group Explorer
3](https://github.com/nathancarter/group-explorer) as a node.js module, and
extends its rendering capabilities to vector graphics formats (SVG, PDF) as
well as PNG.

## Status

This is in early stages of development, and is far from complete. See the
[to-do list](to-do-list.md).

Eventually, it should be possible to use these tools to programmatically
load groups and create visualizations into formats like SVG, PNG, PDF,
Asymptote, TikZ, etc.

For now, we're just getting started.  Check back later!
