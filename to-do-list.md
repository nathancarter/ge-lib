# To-do list

## Improving documentation

 * Fill in the section on installing the CLI
    * Publish on npm
    * Write down that people should `npm install -g ge-lib`
 * Move the usage docs out of the `cli.js` into a text file.
 * Fill in the section on documentation of all options by linking to that
   text file.

## Finding groups

Don't forget to document the rest of the `GE.IsomorphicGroups` features
as well.

## Cayley diagrams

 * Support chunking, or document that you don't yet support it.
    * Add to the `.md` doc how to specify whether to chunk: by
      default, `cd.chunk` is undefined; you can set it to an index
      into the strategy table.
