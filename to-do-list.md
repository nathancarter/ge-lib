# To-do list

## Command-line interface

 * Add the following options/new signatures, adding help for each as
   you create the feature.
    * Add support for "brighten" which will set the value of
      "brightHighlights".  Also document that option for the first time.

## Finding groups

Don't forget to document the rest of the `GE.IsomorphicGroups` features
as well.

## Cayley diagrams

 * Support chunking, or document that you don't yet support it.
    * Add to the `.md` doc how to specify whether to chunk: by
      default, `cd.chunk` is undefined; you can set it to an index
      into the strategy table.
