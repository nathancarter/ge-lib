# To-do list

## Improving documentation

 * Create a CLI documentation page with three parts, none yet filled in:
    * Installing the CLI
    * Examples of using the CLI
    * Official documentation of all options
 * Fill in the section on examples for using the CLI.
 * Fill in the section on installing the CLI by first doing:
    * Publish on npm
    * Figure out how to get the CLI installed globally
 * Move the usage docs out of the `cli.js` into a text file.
 * Fill in the section on documentation of all options by linking to that
   text file.

## Finding groups

Don't forget to document the rest of the `GE.IsomorphicGroups` features
as well.

## Cayley diagrams

 * Support chunking, or document that you don't yet support it.
    * Add to the `.md` doc how to specify whether to chunk: by
      default, `cd.chunk` is undefined; you can set it to an index
      into the strategy table.
