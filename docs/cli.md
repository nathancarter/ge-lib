# Command-Line Interface

Two examples of using the interface appear in
[the README file](../README.md).

## Installing the command-line tool

Very straightforward:

```
npm install -g ge-lib
```

Then you should have the `ge-draw` command in your path.

## Reference of all options

See [the usage output](../cli-usage.txt) that `ge-draw` prints
if you run it with no arguments.
